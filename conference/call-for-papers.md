# Call for Papers

_ISTVS 2026_, the _56th Conference of the International Society for Terrain-Vehicle Systems_ welcomes original and previously unpublished research and review papers describing results of research which are relevant to the conference topics and to terrain-vehicle systems.

* Interested authors are invited to submit an abstract between **16 February and 15 March, 2026**.
* Abstracts must be **under 1800 characters** and must emphasize the objectives and results.
* Authors may choose between the following two types of submissions: **full paper** or **abstract-only**.
* For either type of submission, authors can choose to do an **oral presentation** at the conference or submit a **poster** for the conference poster session. At least one of the authors must attend the conference for either.
